Android BluetoothLeGatt Sample
===================================

This is a ble sniffing app that can track ble advertising beacons. Once a beacon of interest is seen the app can take action on it. In this case we can do text to voice on the arrival of a user, control the screen, send http put commands to a server. In teh last case we control the volume of a sonos stereo system to tack the user they approach the speaker. The Speaker has a ble beacon placed near it.
